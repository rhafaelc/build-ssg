# Static Site Generator in Python

This is a static site generator (SSG) built using Python. The main feature of this project is converting Markdown (`.md`) files into static HTML pages.

## Features

- Converts Markdown files (`.md`) located in the `content/` directory to HTML.
- Easy to use: simply add your `.md` files and start the web with `./main.sh`.

## Usage

1. Add your `.md` files to the `content/` directory.
2. Run `./main.sh` to start the static site generator.
3. The site will be served at `http://0.0.0.0:8888/` (Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8888).

## Additional Notes

- The project has been unit tested. To run the tests, use `./test.sh`.
